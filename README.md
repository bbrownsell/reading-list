A small react app which allows you to add and remove items(books) from a list. 

The whole purpose of this app was give me practice and familiarise myself with the useContext and useReducer hooks. I have also implemented local storage to save the inputted data. 

A working demo can be seen here https://goofy-goodall-70ac8d.netlify.app/
